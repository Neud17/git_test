#Creating my own google home page
Project made for The Odin Project.
In this website I needed to display all elements in a centered way, and learned what makes Google's webpage a great design. All the attention needed to be focused on the center of the page, where the search-bar is, Google's Icon help with that. Text mild coloured and neutral color help focus on the important site's parts.
Regarding to code, I learned how to add some glowing to the search-bar. Also, I got to improve my use of flex-box, which I always thought it was pretty messy, but works with Google's way of compositing their website. Looking at someone else's code can also get to help you understand how a proper code is made, and if there's a part you copy from that site that doesn't work, you'll need to be the one to get to know why it doesn't.
Before this project I already knew a bit of code, but I see how much improvement I've done thanks to redoing that website again and trying things I've never used, despite of knowing about them.
I'll need to work more on how to add images as backgrounds and work more with the distribution of elements.
